---

## 2. Economy Micro-Balancing (WP-2)

### 2.1 Decision: Storm Puzzle Rewards +5%

**Problem**: Storm puzzle completion tracking 65-68%, below 70% target. Player feedback indicates rewards feel underwhelming.

**Solution**: Increase base rewards by +5% (115 CR â†’ 120 CR) and perfect rewards by +10% (170 CR â†’ 180 CR).

**Impact Analysis**:
- Expected completion rate lift: 65% â†’ 72% (+7pp)
- Daily CR injection increase: +18,200 CR systemwide (+5.4%)
- Inflation risk: LOW (mitigated by vendor price adjustment if needed)
- Net effect on earn/spend ratio: +0.02 (within tolerance)

**Deployment**: Canary 10% (2h) â†’ 50% (6h) â†’ 100%

**Status**: âœ… Hotfix ready for deployment (Jan 22)

---

### 2.2 Decision: Boss HP -7% (Echo Sentinel Phase 1)

**Problem**: S1 boss data showed success rates at 48%, below 55% target. S2 boss is more mechanically complex.

**Solution**: Reduce Echo Sentinel Phase 1 HP from 25,000 to 23,250 (-7%), including co-op scaling adjustment.

**Impact Analysis**:
- Expected success rate lift: 48% â†’ 56% (+8pp, within 45-65% target band)
- Fight duration reduction: ~13 sec solo, ~17 sec co-op
- Player frustration reduction: Fewer "brick wall" first attempts
- Economy impact: Minimal (+1,250 CR/day systemwide)

**Deployment**: Hotfix deployed Jan 22 before boss launch (20:00 TRT)

**Status**: âœ… Hotfix ready, boss event scheduled

---

### 2.3 Decision: Vendor Price +3% (Conditional)

**Problem**: If inflation index exceeds 1.08 warning threshold, purchasing power creep needs correction.

**Solution**: Increase vendor prices by +3% across cosmetics, consumables, upgrades (starter bundles exempt).

**Impact Analysis**:
- Mild deflation: -0.03 to -0.05 inflation index reduction
- Player perception: Minimal (3% below Just Noticeable Difference threshold of 5%)
- New player protection: Starter bundles unaffected
- Vendor usage impact: Monitor for drop (target: maintain â‰¥40%)

**Deployment**: Canary 10% (2h) â†’ 50% (6h) â†’ 100%, **ONLY IF** inflation >1.08 on Jan 21

**Status**: âœ… Conditional hotfix ready (apply if needed)

---

### 2.4 Deliverables

**Created**:
- âœ… `LiveOps/economy/patches/s2-w1-hotfix.yaml` - Economy balance adjustments
- âœ… `Docs/S2-W1-BALANCE-NOTE.md` - Before/after comparison and impact analysis

**Approval Status**:
- âœ… Economy Lead: Approved (2026-01-21 18:30 UTC)
- ðŸŸ¡ LiveOps Lead: Pending final sign-off
- ðŸŸ¡ Tech Lead: Pending stability review

- **Preliminary Results**: Variant B shows +3.6pp lift in co-op adoption (p=0.02)
- **Guardrail Concern**: Prompt dismissal rate 61.2% (approaching 70% threshold)
- **Decision**: Continue observation through Day 14 (Jan 28)

**abx-storm-reward** (Storm Puzzle Reward Optimization):
- **Status**: In observation (7-day minimum met)
- **Preliminary Results**: Variant B shows +6.1pp lift in completion (p<0.001)
- **Guardrail Violation**: Inflation index 1.11 (exceeds 1.08 warning threshold)
- **Decision**: Do NOT ship Variant B. Consider Variant A (+2.9pp lift, inflation 1.08 borderline)

**abx-boss-hp-storm** (Boss HP Tuning):
- **Status**: Not yet started (boss launches Jan 22)
- **Duration**: 14 days post-launch (Jan 22 - Feb 5)
- **Decision**: Monitor starting Week 2

---

### 3.2 Key Findings

**Statistical Rigor**:
- All experiments passed SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch) checks âœ“
- No traffic allocation bugs detected âœ“
- Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons âœ“
- Sequential testing boundaries enforced (no early stopping) âœ“

**Novelty Effect**:
- Week 1 data may include novelty bias (players trying new content)
- Require full 14-day observation to capture decay
- Weekend behavior significantly different from weekday (Â±2.8pp variance)

**Experiment Interactions**:
- No significant interaction detected between abx-coop-optin and abx-storm-reward
- Co-op rate similar across all storm-reward arms (26.1-26.8%) âœ“

### 3.3 Week 2 Decision Timeline

| Date       | Milestone                          |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| Jan 22     | Boss launch (abx-boss-hp starts)   |
| Jan 25     | Day 10 check-in (no decisions yet) |
| Jan 28     | Day 14 final analysis              |

---

### 3.4 Deliverables

**Created**:
- âœ… `Docs/S2-W1-PLAYBOOK.md` - A/B observation notes, MDE/power, p-value plan, guardrail monitoring

**Recommendation**:
- **abx-coop-optin**: Lean toward Variant B if guardrails stay safe (watch prompt dismissal)
- **abx-storm-reward**: Likely ship Variant A OR use +5% hotfix (split the difference)
- **abx-boss-hp-storm**: Wait for Week 2 data before deciding

## 8. Lessons Learned

### 8.1 What Went Well

1. **Smooth Launch**: Zero critical incidents, 99.2% uptime across Week 1
2. **Proactive Economy Monitoring**: Caught inflation creep early (Day 4), hotfix ready by Day 7
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: All decisions backed by telemetry, A/B tests, or player feedback
4. **Incident Readiness**: All SLA targets met in dry-run tests (30/60/90 min)
5. **Team Coordination**: Strong collaboration across Economy, LiveOps, SRE, Data teams

---

### 8.2 Areas for Improvement

1. **Storm Puzzle Tuning**: Completion rate below target (65-68% vs 70%) - should have tuned earlier in beta
2. **Weekend Variance**: Significant behavior differences (DAU +8%, co-op +2.8pp) - future events should target weekends
3. **A/B Experiment Duration**: 7-day interim data showed noise - reinforce 14-day minimum policy
4. **Fraud Detection**: Currently reactive (flags after exploit) - need ML-based proactive detection
5. **Player Sentiment Analysis**: Manual Discord/Reddit review is slow - automate with NLP

---
