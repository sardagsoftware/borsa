## P0: Server Outage

### Detection
- Health check fails (GET /api/health returns 500+)
- PagerDuty alert triggers
- User reports spike on social media

### Immediate Actions (0-15 min)
1. **Acknowledge Incident**
   ```bash
   # Acknowledge PagerDuty alert
   pd incident acknowledge --id <incident_id>
   ```

2. **Check Server Status**
   ```bash
   # SSH to production server
   ssh user@production.ailydian.com

   # Check process
   pm2 status
   pm2 logs --lines 100

   # Check disk space
   df -h

   # Check memory
   free -h
   ```

3. **Quick Restart (if safe)**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart server
   # Wait 30 seconds
   curl https://ailydian.com/api/health
   ```

### Investigation (15-60 min)
1. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -n 1000 /var/log/ailydian/server.log | grep ERROR
   ```

2. **Database Connection**
   ```bash
   # Test database connectivity
   psql -h <db_host> -U <db_user> -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

3. **Third-Party Services**
   - Check OpenAI API status
   - Check Azure services status
   - Check Vercel status

### Resolution
- Apply hotfix if code issue identified
- Scale resources if capacity issue
- Rollback if recent deployment caused issue

### Post-Incident
- Update status page
- Post-mortem within 48h
- Document in `LiveOps/phase5/hotfix/post-mortems/`

---

## P0: Database Corruption

### Detection
- Query errors in logs
- Data inconsistency reports
- Foreign key violations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Stop Write Operations**
   ```bash
   # Enable maintenance mode
   curl -X POST https://ailydian.com/api/admin/maintenance \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"enabled": true, "message": "Emergency maintenance"}'
   ```

2. **Create Backup Immediately**
   ```bash
   # PostgreSQL backup
   pg_dump -h <host> -U <user> -d ailydian > backup-emergency-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
   ```

3. **Assess Damage**
   ```sql
   -- Check table integrity
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

   -- Check for orphaned records
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM economy_transactions WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM users);
   ```

### Resolution
- Restore from latest backup if severe
- Run repair scripts if minor
- Apply data migration fixes

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# Restore from backup
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d ailydian < backup-<timestamp>.sql

# Verify restoration
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d ailydian -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

## P0: Economy Exploit

### Detection
- Fraud indicators spike (>20)
- Unusual earn patterns in logs
- Player reports of duplication

### Immediate Actions
1. **Identify Exploit**
   ```sql
   -- Find suspicious transactions
   SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as total_earned
   FROM economy_transactions
   WHERE transaction_type = 'earn'
     AND transaction_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   GROUP BY user_id
   HAVING SUM(amount) > 10000
   ORDER BY total_earned DESC;
   ```

2. **Disable Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Disable vendor if needed
   curl -X POST https://ailydian.com/api/economy/vendor/disable \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
   ```

3. **Ban Exploiters (Temporary)**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users
   SET banned = TRUE, ban_reason = 'Economy exploit investigation'
   WHERE user_id IN (/* list of user IDs */);
   ```

### Investigation
- Review transaction logs
- Identify exploit mechanism
- Check code for vulnerabilities

### Resolution
- Deploy hotfix closing exploit
- Roll back fraudulent transactions
- Permanent ban for repeat offenders
- Appeal process for legitimate players

## P1: Boss HP Tuning Issue

### Detection
- Boss success rate deviates significantly from target
- Player complaints on Discord/forums

### Actions
1. **Check Current Success Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     boss_id,
     COUNT(*) as attempts,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'success') as successes,
     ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'success')::NUMERIC / COUNT(*)::NUMERIC) * 100, 2) as success_rate
   FROM gameplay_boss_encounters
   WHERE encounter_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   GROUP BY boss_id;
   ```

2. **Apply Hotfix**
   ```bash
   # Update boss HP via API
   curl -X PATCH https://ailydian.com/api/liveops/boss/hp \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "boss_id": "colossus",
       "hp_multiplier": 0.9
     }'
   ```

3. **Monitor for 4 Hours**
   - Check success rate hourly
   - Adjust if needed
   - Document changes
