## Data Breach Response Plan

### Phase 1: Detection & Containment (0-1h)
1. Identify breach source
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots)
4. Activate incident response team

### Phase 2: Assessment (1-4h)
1. Determine scope (data exposed, users affected)
2. Assess impact (PII, financial data, etc.)
3. Document timeline
4. Notify stakeholders (exec team, legal)

### Phase 3: Notification (4-72h)
1. Notify affected users (email)
2. Notify authorities (KVKV within 72h)
3. Prepare public statement
4. Update status page

### Phase 4: Remediation (1-7d)
1. Deploy security fixes
2. Reset credentials (if needed)
3. Offer credit monitoring (if financial data exposed)
4. Conduct post-mortem
