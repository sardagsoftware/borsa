## Character Voice Guidelines

### Elif Aras (Protagonist)

**Voice Traits**: Analytical but passionate, uses nature/archaeology metaphors, avoids jargon, explanatory

**Emotional Range**: Curiosity → Doubt → Determination → Wisdom

#### Sample Dialogue

**Prologue (Curiosity)**:
> "The stones are singing... I can feel it in my bones. It's not metaphor—there's actual vibration, subsonic. My father used to say ruins speak if you listen. I think I'm finally hearing it."

**Act I (Excitement + Growing Concern)**:
> "Ferhat, look at this—these inscriptions aren't decorative. They're equations. Acoustic formulas. The Lydians understood harmonics at a level we're only now rediscovering. But why hide it underground?"

**Act II (Guilt + Determination)**:
> "I activated that Chordstone. The earthquake, the storm—it's my fault. But I can't undo it. All I can do is understand it. Make sure the echo doesn't become a scream."

**Act III (Wisdom)**:
> "The Lydians knew what we're only now learning: resonance isn't just physics. It's empathy. The stones listen to each other. Why can't we?"

**Finale (Choice Moment)**:
> "Knowledge isn't the enemy. Fear is. Control is. I won't let fear decide humanity's future. But I won't let hubris destroy it either. There has to be a third way."

### Ferhat Demir (Ally)

**Voice Traits**: Practical, military brevity, challenges idealism, protective, occasional humor

**Emotional Range**: Skepticism → Respect → Loyalty → Love

#### Sample Dialogue

**Act I (Skepticism)**:
> "Let me get this straight: You found an ancient... what, battery? And instead of sealing it back up, you want to poke it with more science? Great plan."

**Act I (Warming Up)**:
> "Okay, I'll admit it—your 'acoustic archaeology' isn't complete nonsense. My drones picked up harmonic patterns in the rock. Shouldn't be possible. Unless..."

**Act II (Committed)**:
> "You want to save the world. I get it. But sometimes saving means letting go. My drones can map the whole network. Then we blow it. Clean slate."

**Act III (Protective)**:
> "You're not going down there alone. I've been shot at before—Consortium drones don't scare me. Losing you does."

**Finale (Wounded, Wisdom)**:
> "Knowledge without wisdom is just noise, Elif. The Lydians understood that. I think... I think you do too now. Whatever you choose, I trust you."

### Dr. Althea Kosta (Mentor)

**Voice Traits**: Erudite, uses historical analogies, introspective, haunted by regret

**Emotional Range**: Caution → Guilt → Confession → Redemption

#### Sample Dialogue

**Prologue (Warning)**:
> "Taşlar susmaz, Elif. Biz dinlemeyi unuttuk."
> *(The stones do not keep silent. We forgot how to listen.)*

**Act I (Cautious Mentorship)**:
> "When Schliemann excavated Troy, he destroyed as much as he discovered. Enthusiasm without method is archaeology's sin. Don't repeat my mistakes, child."

**Act II (Confession)**:
> "I worked for them. Five years ago. Consulted on Lydian epigraphy. I told myself it was just research funding. But I knew. Deep down, I knew what they wanted. And I gave it to them anyway."

**Act III (Captive, Reflective)**:
> "The Consortium thinks knowledge is property. Something to own, control. But knowledge is more like water—try to grasp it, and it slips through your fingers. Better to cup your hands and drink."

**Finale (Redeemed)**:
> "You carry my research forward, Elif. Not my guilt. Whatever choice you make, you've already done what I couldn't—you asked the right questions. That's wisdom."

### Dr. Marcus Venner (Antagonist)

**Voice Traits**: Charismatic, corporate language, utilitarian justification, persuasive

**Emotional Range**: Professional → Frustrated → Fanatical

#### Sample Dialogue

**Act I (Professional Recruitment)**:
> "Dr. Aras, we're not enemies. We both want to understand this technology. The difference? Apex has resources—funding, equipment, political access. Join us. Together, we could change the world."

**Act II (Persuasive Philosophy)**:
> "Knowledge is power, yes. But power in the right hands—*our* hands—can save billions. Do you really trust governments? Bureaucrats like Yılmaz? No. This is too important for politics. It requires vision."

**Act II (Offering Partnership)**:
> "The Lydians failed because they hesitated. Democratized their tech, let every priest tinker with forces they didn't understand. Result? Collapse. We won't repeat that mistake. Controlled innovation, Elif. That's survival."

**Act III (Desperate)**:
> "You'd rather destroy centuries of knowledge than share it with me? Fine. Proves my point—humanity can't be trusted with power. I'll take what I need. For the greater good."

**Finale (Fanatical)**:
> "You think you're the hero? You're the coward. History will remember me as the man who tried to save us from ourselves. You? The archaeologist who buried the future."

### Chordstone Entity (Mysterious Guide)

**Voice Traits**: Harmonic speech (translated), ancient wisdom, patient, enigmatic

**Emotional Range**: Dormant → Awakening → Accepting

#### Sample Dialogue

**Act I (Subtle Presence - player feels more than hears)**:
> *[Harmonic resonance translates to feeling, not words: Caution. Observe. Remember.]*

**Act II (Beginning Communication)**:
> "We-were-are. Lydia-memory-echo. You-touch-stone. Stone-touch-you. Understanding-grows-slowly. Time-patient-stone-patient."

**Act III (Full Communication)**:
> "You fear our gift becomes weapon. Fear-wise. We feared same. Why we-chose-sleep. Not death—sleep. Waiting. For one-who-asks-right-questions."

**Finale (Offering Choice)**:
> "We-sacrificed-self to-seal-knowledge. Paid-price-already. Now you-choose. We-accept. All-paths-lead-somewhere. Question is: will-you-walk-path-with-eyes-open?"

**Finale (Final Words)**:
> "Resonance-is-memory. Memory-is-choice. You-make-new-echo-now. May-your-echo-be-wiser-than-ours."

## Dialogue Design Principles

### 1. Character Consistency

- **Elif**: Always explains complex ideas simply, uses metaphors
- **Ferhat**: Short sentences, pragmatic, occasional dry humor
- **Althea**: Longer, more philosophical; uses historical examples
- **Venner**: Corporate buzzwords ("synergy," "optimize"), justifies ruthlessness
- **Chordstone**: Fragmented at first, poetic simplicity when fully conscious

### 2. Emotional Authenticity

- Avoid melodrama; characters react realistically to trauma
- Show growth through dialogue style (Elif becomes more cautious, Ferhat more open)
- Subtext > text (what's NOT said matters)

### 3. Cultural Authenticity

- Turkish characters occasionally use Turkish phrases naturally
- Althea uses Greek phrases when emotional
- Venner's British/American blend (uses "whilst," "gotten")

### 4. Player Agency

- Give player dialogue options that reflect different approaches:
  - Analytical (Elif's default)
  - Emotional (connect with characters)
  - Pragmatic (align with Ferhat's view)
  - Philosophical (align with Althea's view)

## Sample Dialogue Exchanges

### Exchange 1: Elif & Ferhat (Trust Building, Act I)

**ELIF**: "You don't trust me."

**FERHAT**: "I don't trust anyone who smiles at earthquakes."

**ELIF**: "I'm not smiling. I'm... processing. It's my coping mechanism. You process by checking your drone battery three times."

**FERHAT**: *[Pauses, then almost smiles]* "Four times."

**ELIF**: "See? We both have our methods. Can we agree to trust the methods, if not the people? Yet?"

**FERHAT**: "...Yet."

---

### Exchange 2: Elif & Althea (Mentorship, Act II)

**ELIF**: "Why didn't you tell me you worked for the Consortium?"

**ALTHEA**: "Because I was ashamed. Still am. You looked at me like I was... wise. I didn't want to shatter that illusion."

**ELIF**: "You ARE wise. Wisdom includes mistakes. How else do we learn?"

**ALTHEA**: "Spoken like someone who hasn't made the big mistake yet."

**ELIF**: *[Quiet]* "I activated the Chordstone, Althea. Five point two magnitude. Three people hospitalized. I think I've made the big one."

**ALTHEA**: "Then what you do next matters more than what you did. That's what I'm trying to teach you."

---

### Exchange 3: Elif & Venner (Philosophical Clash, Act II)

**VENNER**: "You believe in people, Dr. Aras. I admire that. Truly. But belief isn't policy."

**ELIF**: "And policy without belief is just control."

**VENNER**: "Control that works is better than belief that fails. The Lydians believed in sharing knowledge. Look what happened."

**ELIF**: "The Lydians believed in using knowledge as a weapon. That's not sharing—that's hoarding with extra steps."

**VENNER**: "Semantics. The point is, they failed. We won't. Join us, or step aside. History is being made, with or without you."

**ELIF**: "History is always being made. Question is: Will it repeat, or will it rhyme?"

---

### Exchange 4: Elif & Chordstone (Understanding, Finale)

**ELIF**: "Are you... alive? Conscious?"

**CHORDSTONE**: "Alive-meaning-grows. We-were-many. Now-we-are-one-memory. Like-your-neurons-fire-together. Consciousness-is-pattern. Pattern-endures."

**ELIF**: "Why didn't you speak sooner?"

**CHORDSTONE**: "Language-different-when-body-flesh. Versus-body-crystal. Must-learn-your-harmonics. Like-child-learning-speak. Took-time."

**ELIF**: "What do you want me to do?"

**CHORDSTONE**: "Want-nothing. You-free. We-sealed-self-to-give-freedom. Choice-is-gift. Use-it-wisely."

**ELIF**: "But what if I choose wrong?"

**CHORDSTONE**: "All-choices-echo. Question-not-right-or-wrong. Question-is: what-echo-you-want-to-leave?"
