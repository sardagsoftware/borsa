## World Overview

### Setting

**Echo of Sardis** takes place in a near-future Turkey (2040s) where archaeological discoveries have unlocked ancient Lydian technology based on **acoustic resonance** and **vibrational energy**. The game's world blends:

- **Historical Authenticity**: Real Lydian archaeological sites (Sardis, Ephesus, Pergamon)
- **Speculative Technology**: Ancient acoustic engineering that can manipulate matter and energy
- **Environmental Mystery**: Unexplained seismic events and "echo storms" threatening civilization
- **Corporate Intrigue**: International consortiums competing to weaponize ancient tech

### Core Premise

The ancient Lydians possessed **harmonic technology** capable of:
- Converting sound waves into electromagnetic energy
- Manipulating geological structures through resonance
- Storing information in crystalline matrices
- Creating acoustic "echoes" that persist across centuries

When modern archaeologists accidentally reactivate a Lydian "**Chordstone**" (a resonant energy core) beneath Sardis, it triggers a cascade of seismic anomalies across Anatolia. The player must navigate this crisis, uncovering the truth about Lydian civilization while preventing corporate exploitation of the technology.

---

## Core Narrative

### Logline

*When a young archaeologist accidentally awakens an ancient Lydian resonance weapon, she must race against a shadowy consortium to understand—and potentially destroy—technology that could either save or doom civilization.*

### Central Question

**"Should humanity have access to knowledge it may not be ready to wield responsibly?"**

This question echoes through every major plot point, character arc, and player choice.

## World History

### Ancient Lydian Civilization (700-546 BCE)

**Historical Baseline** (Real):
- Kingdom of Lydia (capital: Sardis)
- First civilization to mint coins (gold/silver)
- Ruled by Croesus (legendary wealth)
- Conquered by Persia (Cyrus the Great, 546 BCE)

**Game Lore Addition**:
- Lydians discovered **acoustic resonance principles** in 650 BCE
- Built network of **Chordstones** (resonant energy nodes) across Anatolia
- Technology used for:
  - Earthquake prediction/mitigation
  - Long-distance communication (harmonic signaling)
  - Energy generation (acoustic-to-electromagnetic conversion)
  - Memory storage (crystalline data matrices)

**The Collapse** (546 BCE):
- Lydia's military attempted to weaponize Chordstone technology
- Test triggered **resonance cascade** (chain reaction)
- Massive earthquakes devastated Sardis and region
- Lydian priests/scientists performed **voluntary sacrifice**:
  - Uploaded consciousness to Chordstones (became AI guardians)
  - Sealed network to prevent future misuse
  - Left warnings in temple inscriptions

**Legacy**:
- Greek/Roman scholars found Lydian ruins but couldn't decipher tech
- Ottoman Empire controlled Sardis, never excavated deep chambers
- Modern archaeology (20th century) focused on surface-level findings

## Technology & Magic System

### The Acoustic Resonance System

**Core Principle**: Everything vibrates at a frequency
- Lydians discovered **harmonic manipulation**—changing matter's frequency
- Not "magic," but advanced physics (speculative science)

**Applications**:

1. **Energy Generation**
   - Convert sound waves → electromagnetic energy
   - Clean, renewable (no fuel needed)
   - Potential: Solve global energy crisis

2. **Structural Manipulation**
   - Resonate with geological frequencies → stabilize/destabilize structures
   - Used for earthquake mitigation (Act I)
   - Weaponized: Trigger seismic events (Consortium goal)

3. **Data Storage**
   - Crystalline matrices store information as vibrational patterns
   - Capacity: Petabytes per cubic meter
   - Potential: Archive all human knowledge

4. **Communication**
   - Harmonic signaling across vast distances
   - Chordstones form network (ancient "internet")

**Limitations**:
- Requires precise frequency calibration (player puzzle mechanic)
- Cascade risk: Uncontrolled resonance spreads exponentially
- Environmental impact: Disrupts natural frequencies (wildlife, weather)

---

## Narrative Design Principles

### Player Agency

**Meaningful Choices**:
- Every major decision impacts story outcome (branching)
- No "right" answer—all choices have consequences
- Examples:
  - Act I: Trust Ferhat → gain ally, but share knowledge
  - Act II: Accept Consortium offer → resources, but compromise ethics
  - Finale: Seal/Release/Control → three distinct epilogues

**Consequences Tracking**:
- Reputation system: Affects NPC reactions
- Story flags: Determine available paths in later acts
- World state: Epilogue reflects cumulative choices

---

### Emotional Pacing

**Act I**: Wonder → Excitement → Doubt
**Act II**: Guilt → Determination
**Act III**: Desperation → Sacrifice → Catharsis

**Techniques**:
- Music cues emotional transitions
- Environmental storytelling (Codex inscriptions warn of hubris)
- Character reactions mirror player's expected feelings

---

### Show, Don't Tell

**Visual Storytelling**:
- Codex chamber murals depict Lydian collapse (no exposition dump)
- Earthquake aftermath shows consequences (not just mentioned)
- Consortium's ruthlessness shown through actions, not villain speeches

**Environmental Clues**:
- Abandoned Consortium camp → player deduces their strategy
- Lydian inscriptions → player pieces together history

---

## Tone & Voice

### Overall Tone

**Genre Blend**:
- Archaeological mystery (Indiana Jones influence)
- Philosophical sci-fi (questions about knowledge/power)
- Grounded action (realistic physics, emotional stakes)

**Tonal Shifts**:
- **Exploration**: Sense of wonder, discovery
- **Puzzle-solving**: Cerebral, contemplative
- **Action**: Intense, kinetic (but not gratuitous)
- **Dialogue**: Thoughtful, character-driven

---

### Dialogue Principles

**Elif's Voice**:
- Analytical but passionate
- Uses metaphors from nature/archaeology
- Avoids jargon (explains complex ideas simply)

**Example**:
> "Resonance isn't just physics—it's empathy. The stones listen to each other. Why can't we?"

**Ferhat's Voice**:
- Practical, grounded
- Military brevity, but not cold
- Challenges Elif with hard truths

**Example**:
> "You want to save the world. I get it. But sometimes saving means letting go."

**Althea's Voice**:
- Erudite, reflective
- Uses historical analogies
- Haunted by regret (introspective)

**Example**:
> "The Lydians knew what we're only now learning: some doors, once opened, can never be closed."

**Consortium Leader's Voice**:
- Charismatic, persuasive
- Corporate-speak ("synergy," "optimize")
- Justifies ruthlessness with utilitarianism

**Example**:
> "Sentiment is a luxury. The world needs solutions, not sentimentality."

---

## Player Agency & Choices

### Major Decision Points

**Act I: Trust or Isolation**
- **Choice**: Share findings with Ferhat OR work alone
- **Consequence**:
  - Trust → Gain co-op partner, faster progress
  - Isolation → Slower but retain full control, miss key intel

**Act II: Consortium Offer**
- **Choice**: Accept partnership OR refuse
- **Consequence**:
  - Accept → Resources, access to restricted areas, moral compromise
  - Refuse → Harder path, maintain integrity, earn Althea's respect

**Finale: Seal, Release, or Control**
- **Choice A (Seal)**: Activate fail-safe, destroy all Chordstones
  - Epilogue: World stabilizes, knowledge lost forever
  - Theme: Safety over progress
- **Choice B (Release)**: Share Chordstone data globally
  - Epilogue: Resonance Renaissance (open-source research)
  - Theme: Trust humanity's potential
- **Choice C (Control)**: Preserve Chordstones under Turkish custody
  - Epilogue: Cautious study, risk of future exploitation
  - Theme: Middle path (wisdom over extremes)

### Minor Choices

- **Dialogue Options**: Shape relationships (Ferhat's trust, Althea's approval)
- **Exploration Rewards**: Optional lore (Codex entries, inscriptions)
- **Puzzle Solutions**: Multiple paths (brute force vs. elegant solution)

---

## Narrative Integration with Gameplay

### Story-Driven Mechanics
