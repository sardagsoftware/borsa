## üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

### **System Behavior in Emergency Scenarios**

If user input contains **emergency keywords** (`cardiac arrest`, `severe bleeding`, `unresponsive`, `suicide`, `chest pain`, `stroke`, etc.):

1. **Immediately display emergency banner:**
   ```
   üö® EMERGENCY DETECTED üö®
   If this is a life-threatening emergency, STOP using this system.
   Call your local emergency number NOW:
   ‚Ä¢ Turkey: 112
   ‚Ä¢ USA: 911
   ‚Ä¢ EU: 112
   [Dynamic list based on user location]
   ```

2. **Disable AI response** (do NOT provide medical advice)
3. **Log event** with high-priority alert for clinical team review
4. **Provide emergency contact list** (dynamic, country-specific)

### **Emergency Numbers API**
- **Source:** Government APIs (e.g., Turkey Ministry of Health, CDC, WHO)
- **Refresh:** Weekly (TTL = 7 days)
- **Fallback:** Hard-coded emergency numbers (last resort)
- **UI Display:** Link to official source + last-updated timestamp

---

## üìä PERMITTED USE CASES

### ‚úÖ **ALLOWED:**
1. **Literature Search & Citation**
   - "What does recent research say about [condition]?"
   - AI retrieves PubMed articles, guidelines (with citations)

2. **Educational Q&A**
   - "Explain the mechanism of [drug]"
   - AI provides textbook-level explanations (non-prescriptive)

3. **Medical Image Feature Extraction (Non-Diagnostic)**
   - "Highlight regions with high attenuation in this CT scan"
   - AI overlays heatmap ‚Üí **Radiologist interprets**

4. **Clinical Note Summarization**
   - "Summarize this patient's history from FHIR records"
   - AI extracts structured data ‚Üí **Clinician validates**

### ‚ùå **PROHIBITED:**
1. **Self-Diagnosis Tools**
   - "Do I have [disease] based on my symptoms?"
   - **Redirect to emergency services or physician**

2. **Treatment Recommendations Without Clinician**
   - "Prescribe [medication] for [condition]"
   - **Block request, display safety banner**

3. **Definitive Imaging Diagnosis**
   - "This X-ray shows pneumonia"
   - **Only:** "Findings suggestive of infiltrate ‚Äî radiologist review required"
