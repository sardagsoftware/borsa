## Controls

### Keyboard
- **W / ↑** - Move forward
- **S / ↓** - Move backward
- **A / ←** - Move left
- **D / →** - Move right
- **Space** - Jump
- **P** or **Puzzle Button** - Open puzzle panel

### Gamepad
- **Left Stick** - Movement
- **Button 0 (A/Cross)** - Jump

---

## How to Play

1. **Navigate:** Use WASD or arrow keys to move your character around the scene
2. **Explore:** The character controller uses physics, so you can jump and interact with the environment
3. **Solve Puzzle:** Click "Open Puzzle" button (or press P) to access the harmonic puzzle
4. **Tune Frequencies:** Adjust each column's slider to match the target frequencies:
   - Column 1: 220 Hz
   - Column 2: 330 Hz
   - Column 3: 440 Hz
5. **Save Progress:** Use the Save button to persist your puzzle state
6. **Load Progress:** Use the Load button to restore your previous state
7. **Unlock Door:** When all frequencies match (±5 Hz tolerance), click "Solve" to open the door

## Character Model Support

The system supports GLB character models with animations:

1. Place your character model at: `public/assets/models/character.glb`
2. Model requirements:
   - Format: GLB (binary GLTF)
   - Recommended size: ~500KB optimized
   - Animations: "Idle" and "Walk" (optional)

**Free model sources:**
- [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) - Animated characters
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable) - Community models

**Fallback:** If no model is found, a simple capsule mesh is used automatically.

## Performance

- **60 FPS target** with real-time FPS monitoring
- **Optimized rendering** with automatic LOD
- **Physics simulation** running at fixed timestep
- **Hot reload support** for rapid development

## Character Story Integration

The playable demo features characters from the **Echo of Sardis** narrative:

- **Melisa Sarı** (Protagonist) - Archaeologist exploring ancient Lydian ruins
- **Melih Sarı** (Ally) - Engineer assisting with technology

The harmonic puzzle reflects the story's theme of acoustic archaeology and resonance-based ancient technology.
