## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Install button not appearing
**Solution:**
- Check DevTools Console for errors
- Verify manifest link: `<link rel="manifest" href="/lydian-manifest.json">`
- Ensure HTTPS (PWA requires secure context)
- Check beforeinstallprompt event in console

### Issue: iOS install not working
**Expected:** iOS doesn't support native install prompt
**Solution:** User must manually install via Share → Add to Home Screen

### Issue: Service worker not registering
**Solution:**
- Check `/lydian-iq-sw.js` exists and is accessible
- Verify HTTPS (service workers require secure origin)
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Install button still visible after install
**Desktop:** Should auto-remove via `appinstalled` event
**iOS:** Expected (iOS doesn't fire `appinstalled`)
**Solution:** Check `localStorage.getItem('pwa-installed')`
