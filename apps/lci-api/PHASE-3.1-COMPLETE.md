# LCI Phase 3.1 Complete ✅
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Complete - Brand Panel + SLA Tracking

## Summary
Phase 3.1 (Brand Panel + SLA Timer) has been successfully implemented with comprehensive SLA tracking, brand response management, and dashboard statistics. Brands can now respond to complaints and track their performance against SLA targets.

---

## Completed Features

### 1. SLA Service ✅
**File**: `src/brands/sla.service.ts`

**SLA Targets**:
- **First Response**: 24 hours (normal complaints)
- **First Response**: 4 hours (CRITICAL complaints)
- **Resolution**: 72 hours (3 days)

**Methods**:

#### calculateElapsedTime()
Calculates time elapsed since complaint was published
- Returns duration in hours
- Used for real-time SLA monitoring

#### calculateResponseTime()
Calculates time between complaint and first brand response
- Returns duration in hours
- Used for response time metrics

#### isFirstResponseBreached()
Checks if first response SLA is breached
```typescript
{
  breached: boolean;          // true if SLA violated
  elapsedHours: number;       // Time since published
  targetHours: number;        // SLA target
  remainingHours: number;     // Time left (0 if breached)
}
```

#### isResolutionBreached()
Checks if resolution SLA is breached
- Only applies to unresolved complaints (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, ESCALATED)
- RESOLVED/REJECTED complaints don't count as breached

#### calculateSlaMetrics()
Comprehensive SLA metrics for a complaint
```typescript
{
  firstResponse: {
    breached: boolean;
    elapsedHours: number;
    targetHours: number;
    remainingHours: number;
    respondedAt?: Date;
    responseTimeHours?: number;
  };
  resolution: {
    breached: boolean;
    elapsedHours: number;
    targetHours: number;
    remainingHours: number;
  };
  overallStatus: 'GREEN' | 'YELLOW' | 'RED';
}
```

**SLA Status Colors**:
- **GREEN**: SLA healthy (>4h remaining for first response, >12h for resolution)
- **YELLOW**: SLA at risk (<4h remaining for first response, <12h for resolution)
- **RED**: SLA breached (response/resolution overdue)

#### calculateBrandStats()
Brand-level SLA statistics
```typescript
{
  totalComplaints: number;
  openComplaints: number;
  resolvedComplaints: number;
  slaBreaches: number;
  slaCompliance: number;      // Percentage (0-100)
  avgResponseTimeHours: number;
  avgResolutionTimeHours: number;
}
```

---

### 2. Brands Service ✅
**File**: `src/brands/brands.service.ts`

**Methods**:

#### createResponse()
Creates a brand response to a complaint

**Access Control**:
- **BRAND_AGENT**: Can respond (brand assignment verification needed)
- **MODERATOR**: Can respond on behalf of any brand
- **ADMIN**: Can respond on behalf of any brand

**Business Logic**:
- Can only respond to OPEN or IN_PROGRESS complaints
- First response automatically moves complaint to IN_PROGRESS
- Creates ComplaintEvent for audit trail
- Logs all responses

**Response Flow**:
```
User submits complaint
  ↓
Complaint published (OPEN state)
  ↓
Brand Agent responds
  ↓
State changes to IN_PROGRESS
  ↓
Event created (type: RESPONSE)
  ↓
SLA metrics updated
```

#### getBrandDashboard()
Comprehensive brand dashboard with statistics

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  brand: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
  };
  statistics: {
    total: number;
    open: number;
    resolved: number;
    byState: {
      DRAFT: number;
      OPEN: number;
      IN_PROGRESS: number;
      RESOLVED: number;
      ESCALATED: number;
      REJECTED: number;
    };
    bySeverity: {
      LOW: number;
      MEDIUM: number;
      HIGH: number;
      CRITICAL: number;
    };
  };
  sla: {
    breaches: number;
    compliance: number;             // Percentage
    avgResponseTimeHours: number;
    avgResolutionTimeHours: number;
  };
  urgentComplaints: Array<{        // Top 10 most urgent
    id: string;
    title: string;
    severity: string;
    publishedAt: Date;
    sla: SlaMetrics;
  }>;
}
```

**Urgent Complaints Sorting**:
1. RED status (SLA breached) - highest priority
2. YELLOW status (SLA at risk)
3. GREEN status (SLA healthy)
4. Within same status: sorted by remaining time (ascending)

#### listBrandComplaints()
Lists all complaints for a brand with SLA metrics
- Each complaint includes full SLA breakdown
- Sorted by createdAt (descending)
- Includes user info (for contact)
- Includes first response info

#### getComplaintResponses()
Gets all responses for a complaint
- Sorted chronologically (ascending)
- Used to display conversation thread

---

## Database Schema Updates

### BrandResponse Model (Prisma)
```prisma
model BrandResponse {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid()) @db.Uuid
  complaintId String   @db.Uuid
  brandId     String   @db.Uuid
  message     String   @db.Text
  respondedBy String   @db.Uuid  // User who responded
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  complaint Complaint @relation(fields: [complaintId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  brand     Brand     @relation(fields: [brandId], references: [id])

  @@index([complaintId])
  @@index([brandId])
  @@index([createdAt])
}
```

---

## SLA Calculation Logic

### First Response SLA

**Normal Complaints** (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH):
- Target: 24 hours from publishedAt
- Breached if: No response after 24 hours
- Warning if: <4 hours remaining

**Critical Complaints**:
- Target: 4 hours from publishedAt
- Breached if: No response after 4 hours
- Warning if: <1 hour remaining

**Calculation**:
```typescript
const elapsedHours = (now - publishedAt) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
const targetHours = severity === 'CRITICAL' ? 4 : 24;
const remainingHours = Math.max(0, targetHours - elapsedHours);
const breached = !hasResponse && elapsedHours > targetHours;
```

### Resolution SLA

**All Complaints**:
- Target: 72 hours (3 days) from publishedAt
- Breached if: Not resolved after 72 hours
- Warning if: <12 hours remaining
- Not breached if: State is RESOLVED or REJECTED

**Calculation**:
```typescript
const elapsedHours = (now - publishedAt) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
const targetHours = 72;
const unresolvedStates = ['OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'ESCALATED'];
const breached = unresolvedStates.includes(state) && elapsedHours > targetHours;
```

---

## SLA Compliance Metrics

### Compliance Percentage
```typescript
slaCompliance = ((totalComplaints - slaBreaches) / totalComplaints) * 100
```

**Examples**:
- 100 complaints, 5 breaches = 95% compliance
- 50 complaints, 0 breaches = 100% compliance
- 10 complaints, 3 breaches = 70% compliance

### Average Response Time
```typescript
avgResponseTime = totalResponseTime / numberOfResponses
```

Only counts complaints that received at least one response.

### Average Resolution Time
```typescript
avgResolutionTime = totalResolutionTime / numberOfResolvedComplaints
```

Only counts RESOLVED or REJECTED complaints.
