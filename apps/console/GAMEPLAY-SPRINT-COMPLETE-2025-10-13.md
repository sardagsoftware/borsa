| **ESC** | Open puzzle/pause menu |
| **P** | Toggle photo mode |
| **Enter** | Advance dialogue |
| **Gamepad** | Full support (LS + A) |

### 📦 Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "howler": "^2.2.4",
  "@types/howler": "^2.2.11"
}
```

### 🎨 Visual Features

- **Boss Health Bar**: Floating above boss with color transitions
- **Rain Particles**: Blue-tinted droplets falling continuously
- **Dialogue Box**: Bottom-center with backdrop blur
- **Save Slot UI**: Integrated into Settings panel

### ⚙️ Technical Implementation

**Boss Combat Flow**:
1. Player presses F or clicks
2. CombatController dispatches 'hit' event with damage value
3. Boss receives event, reduces HP
4. Health bar updates color based on remaining HP
5. On 0 HP, boss plays defeat sound and calls onDefeat()
6. Boss component removed from scene

**Save System Flow**:
1. User clicks "Save 1/2/3" button
2. System attempts server save first (`/lydian/save/put?slot=N`)
3. On failure, falls back to localStorage (`eos:save:N`)
4. Stores: version, timestamp, slot, checkpoint, doorOpen, position
5. Load reverses the process, preferring server data

**Weather Rendering**:
- Uses THREE.Points for efficient particle rendering
- BufferGeometry with Float32Array for positions
- Updates particle Y positions every frame
- Wraps particles when they fall below Y=0

### 🔊 Audio System (Optional Assets)

Place audio files in `public/assets/play/audio/` to enable sounds:
- `swing.mp3` - Attack sound (plays on F press)
- `hit.mp3` - Damage sound (plays when boss is hit)
- `boss_down.mp3` - Defeat sound (plays when boss HP reaches 0)

Without audio files, the system works silently with haptic feedback on mobile.

### 📝 Dialogue System (Expandable)

Add more dialogue files in `public/assets/play/dialogue/`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "DLG-XX",
    "speaker": "Character Name",
    "tr": "Turkish text",
    "en": "English text"
  }
]
```

Pass file path to Dialogue component:
```tsx
<Dialogue file="/assets/play/dialogue/chapter2.json" />
```

### 🎯 Testing

```bash
# Server running on port 3100
http://localhost:3100/console/play-pro

# Test sequence:
1. Move around with WASD
2. Press F to attack the golden boss
3. Watch health bar decrease with combo damage
4. Press ESC for puzzle menu
5. Press P for photo mode
6. Press Enter to advance dialogue
7. Test Save/Load with 3 slots
8. Switch language TR/EN in Settings
```

### 📊 Performance Stats

- **Rain particles**: 1500 (60 FPS on mid-range GPU)
- **Boss AI**: Simple patrol (minimal CPU usage)
- **Combat cooldowns**: Prevent spam attacks
- **Dynamic imports**: All heavy components lazy-loaded
