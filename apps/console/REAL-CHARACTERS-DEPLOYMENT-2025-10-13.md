## üé® PRODUCTION MODE: Your Custom Characters

### How to Switch to Your Own GLB Files:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your GLB Models

Export from Blender or Mixamo with these **EXACT** animation clip names:
- `Idle` (idle stance)
- `Walk` (walking animation)
- `Run` (running animation)

**Blender Export Settings:**
```
File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí glTF 2.0 (.glb)
‚úÖ Include ‚Üí Animations
‚úÖ Skinned Meshes
‚úÖ Animation clip names: Idle, Walk, Run (case-sensitive!)
Format: GLB (binary .glb)
```

**Mixamo Workflow:**
```
1. Select character + animation
2. Download as FBX for Unity
3. Import to Blender
4. Rename animations to: Idle, Walk, Run
5. Export as GLB
```

#### Step 2: Place GLB Files

Put your GLB files in the correct location:
```
apps/console/public/assets/play/characters/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Elif.glb    ‚Üê Your custom Elif character
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Melih.glb   ‚Üê Your custom Melih character
```

#### Step 3: Switch to Production Mode

Edit: `apps/console/src/lib/playpro/char-config.ts`

Change line 9:
```typescript
const USE_DEMO_MODELS = true;  // Demo mode
```

To:
```typescript
const USE_DEMO_MODELS = false; // Production mode
```

#### Step 4: Verify

1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Check **ASSETS** panel (top-right corner)
3. Look for:
   - ‚úî **green** = GLB file loaded successfully
   - ‚úñ **red** = GLB file missing (using capsule fallback)

## üìä Demo Character URLs

Currently using these Khronos glTF Sample Models:

### RobotExpressive (Elif Demo)
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/main/Models/RobotExpressive/glTF-Binary/RobotExpressive.glb
```
- **Animations**: Idle, Walking, Running, and more
- **License**: CC0 / Public Domain
- **Features**: Rigged, skinned, multiple animations

### CesiumMan (Melih Demo)
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/main/Models/CesiumMan/glTF-Binary/CesiumMan.glb
```
- **Animations**: Cesium_Man (looped)
- **License**: CC0 / Public Domain
- **Features**: Simple animated character

---

## ‚ö° Performance

### Optimizations Applied:
- **Dynamic Imports**: Scene loads with `ssr: false`

- **DPR Capping**: Max 2x device pixel ratio
- **Quality Settings**: Low/Medium/Ultra presets
- **Resolution Scaling**: User-configurable
- **Effect Composer**: Bloom + SSAO
- **Shadow Maps**: 2048 (medium) / 4096 (ultra)
- **Animation LOD**: Automatic animation blending

### Browser Support:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Full support
- ‚úÖ Firefox - Full support
- ‚úÖ Safari - Full support (may need polyfills for some features)
- ‚úÖ Mobile - Works on iOS/Android (touch controls)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing capsule geometry"

**Check 1: Asset Health Panel**
```
Look at top-right corner:
‚úî green = Model loaded (should see 3D character)
‚úñ red = Model missing (showing capsule fallback)
```

**Check 2: File Location**
```bash
# Verify files exist:
ls -la apps/console/public/assets/play/characters/

# Should show:
Elif.glb
Melih.glb
```

**Check 3: Animation Clip Names**
```
Open GLB in Blender ‚Üí Dope Sheet ‚Üí Action Editor
Animation clip names MUST be exactly: Idle, Walk, Run
(Case-sensitive!)
```

**Check 4: Browser Cache**
```
Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Or add: ?nocache=1 to URL
```

### "Model is too big/small"

Don't worry! The auto-scaling system handles this automatically using THREE.Box3 bounding box calculations. The model will be scaled to ~1.8 units (human height) regardless of export size.

### "Animations not playing"

**Check animation clip names:**
```typescript
// In Blender/Mixamo, animations must be named:
Idle   ‚Üê Idle stance
Walk   ‚Üê Walking animation
Run    ‚Üê Running animation
```

**Check browser console (F12):**
```
Look for errors like:
"Animation 'Idle' not found"
"Animation 'Walk' not found"
```

If you see these errors, the animation clip names in your GLB don't match the expected names.

### "CORS error when loading demo characters"

This is expected if GitHub CDN is blocked. The demo characters are hosted externally. To fix:
1. Switch to production mode (USE_DEMO_MODELS = false)
2. Place your own GLB files locally

## üìû Support

**If you see capsule geometry:**
1. Check ASSETS panel (top-right) - is it ‚úî green or ‚úñ red?
2. If red, the GLB file is missing or path is incorrect
3. If green but still capsule, check browser console (F12) for errors

**If animations don't play:**
1. Open GLB in Blender
2. Check animation clip names exactly match: Idle, Walk, Run
3. Re-export if names are wrong

**If model is wrong size:**
1. This should auto-correct, but if not, check console (F12)
2. Look for THREE.Box3 errors
3. Model may have invalid geometry
