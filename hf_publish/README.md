[![Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Public-green)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed)

## üìñ Overview

**LyDian Discovery** is a curated, continuously-updated feed of new AI/LLM models and datasets from the global AI ecosystem. This feed serves as a central discovery point for:

- **New Model Releases** from Hugging Face, arXiv, ModelScope, and official catalogs
- **Benchmark Results** from Open LLM Leaderboard, MMLU, HumanEval, and more
- **Community Signals** including downloads, likes, and usage trends
- **Multi-modal Models** covering text, vision, audio, and multi-modal AI

### Purpose

This dataset is designed to:
1. **Enable AI discovery** for developers, researchers, and organizations
2. **Provide structured metadata** for model search and recommendation systems
3. **Track AI ecosystem trends** with time-series data on model releases
4. **Support white-hat indexing** for search engines and AI platforms

## üìä Data Sources

### Primary Sources
1. **Hugging Face Hub** - Official model releases and metadata
2. **arXiv** - Research papers and model announcements
3. **Open LLM Leaderboard** - Benchmark scores and rankings
4. **ModelScope** - Chinese AI model ecosystem
5. **Official Catalogs** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta announcements

### Update Frequency

- **Daily:** Hugging Face trending models
- **Weekly:** arXiv paper-model mappings
- **Monthly:** Historical data cleanup and validation

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Direct Access
```bash
# JSON Feed
curl https://www.ailydian.com/feed/ai_models.json

# RSS Feed
curl https://www.ailydian.com/feed/ai_models.rss
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests
import json

# Fetch latest models
response = requests.get('https://www.ailydian.com/feed/ai_models.json')
models = response.json()

# Filter by type
text_models = [m for m in models if m['model_type'] == 'text-generation']

# Sort by signals
top_models = sorted(models, key=lambda x: x['signals']['downloads'], reverse=True)[:10]

print(f"Top 10 models by downloads: {[m['name'] for m in top_models]}")
```

### Integration with AI Systems
```python
# Use in AI discovery systems
from lydian_discovery import DiscoveryFeed

feed = DiscoveryFeed('https://www.ailydian.com/feed/ai_models.json')

# Get models released this week
recent = feed.get_models(days=7)

# Get models by organization
mistral_models = feed.filter_by_org('mistralai')

# Get top-performing models
top = feed.get_top_performers(metric='mmlu', limit=20)
```
