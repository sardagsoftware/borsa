### Data Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier (format: `source:org/model_id`) |
| `name` | string | Human-readable model name |
| `org` | string | Organization or author |
| `source` | string | Source platform (huggingface, arxiv, modelscope, official) |
| `model_type` | string | Model category (text-generation, text2text, image-generation, etc.) |
| `released_at` | ISO8601 | Official release date |
| `link` | URL | Direct link to model page or paper |
| `description` | string | Brief model description |

- `avg_score` (float): Average benchmark score (0-100)
- `benchmarks` (object): Specific benchmark results (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.)

### Data Splits

This dataset is continuously updated and does not have traditional train/val/test splits. It can be considered a **streaming dataset** with daily updates.

**Current size:** ~1,247 models (as of 2025-10-09)

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The AI model ecosystem is fragmented across multiple platforms (Hugging Face, arXiv, ModelScope, official releases). This dataset aggregates model metadata from these sources to provide:

1. **Unified discovery** across platforms
2. **Standardized metadata** for search and recommendation
3. **Benchmark aggregation** for model comparison
4. **Time-series data** for ecosystem analysis

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Data is collected from:

1. **Hugging Face Hub API** (https://huggingface.co/api)
   - Model cards and metadata
   - Download/like statistics
   - License information

2. **arXiv API** (https://arxiv.org/help/api)
   - Papers with model releases
   - Abstract and author information

3. **Open LLM Leaderboard** (https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)
   - Benchmark scores (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.)

4. **Official Announcements**
   - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta blogs
   - GitHub releases

**Normalization:**
- All dates converted to ISO8601 UTC
- License identifiers mapped to SPDX
- URLs validated and checked
- Schema validation on all entries

#### Who are the source language producers?

Metadata is produced by:
- Model authors and organizations
- Platform maintainers (Hugging Face, arXiv)
- Benchmark evaluators
- Community curators (LyDian AI team)

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

**Automated:**
- Metadata extracted via APIs
- Benchmark scores aggregated from leaderboards
- Download/like statistics refreshed daily

**Manual:**
- License verification for ambiguous cases
- Quality checks for descriptions
- Duplicate detection and resolution

#### Who are the annotators?

- **Automated systems:** API extraction scripts (white-hat, rate-limited)
- **Manual review:** LyDian AI Discovery team
- **Community:** Model authors can request corrections

### Personal and Sensitive Information

**This dataset contains NO personal or sensitive information.**

- Only public model metadata
- No user data
- No API keys or credentials
- No private/internal model information

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

**Positive:**
- Democratizes AI model discovery
- Reduces barrier to entry for developers
- Enables research on AI ecosystem trends
- Supports white-hat search engine indexing

**Neutral:**
- Lists models without endorsement or bias
- Includes models from all organizations equally

**Potential Negative:**
- May inadvertently list models with known safety issues (we include warnings when detected)

### Discussion of Biases

**Platform Bias:**
- Hugging Face models are over-represented (71.5%) due to API availability
- Closed-source models (GPT-4, Claude) have limited metadata

**Geographic Bias:**
- English-language platforms dominate
- Chinese platforms (ModelScope) underrepresented

**Temporal Bias:**
- Recent models have more complete metadata
- Historical models may have sparse signals

**Mitigation:**
- Explicitly document source distribution
- Actively seek non-Hugging Face sources
- Include metadata completeness scores

### Other Known Limitations

1. **Latency:** Up to 24h delay for new model releases
2. **Broken Links:** Monthly sweeps, but some links may break between checks
3. **Benchmark Coverage:** Not all models have benchmark scores
4. **License Accuracy:** Depends on source platform accuracy
