## 🧠 Strategy Aggregator System

**File**: `src/lib/strategy-aggregator.ts`

### How It Works:
1. All 6 strategies run in parallel on a given coin
2. Each strategy returns a signal with strength (1-10)
3. Strategies are weighted by historical success rate
4. Weighted average produces confidence score (0-100%)
5. Agreement count calculated (how many strategies agree)

### Decision Logic:
- **STRONG BUY**: 4+ strategies agree + 70%+ confidence
- **BUY**: 3+ strategies agree + 60%+ confidence
- **MODERATE BUY**: 2+ strategies agree + 50%+ confidence
- **NEUTRAL**: Insufficient agreement

### Output:
- Overall recommendation
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Agreement count (X/6 strategies)
- Suggested entry, stop loss, take profit
- Individual strategy breakdowns

---

## 🎨 User Interface
