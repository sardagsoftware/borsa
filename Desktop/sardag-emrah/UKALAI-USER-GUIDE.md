## Risk Management

### Golden Rules

1. **Always use stop loss** - Protect your capital!
2. **Never risk more than 2% per trade** - Position sizing matters
3. **Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose**
4. **Diversify** - Don't put all eggs in one basket
5. **Follow your plan** - Stick to your strategy

### Using UKALAI's Risk Levels

**Entry Price**: Suggested entry point
- Use as a guide, not absolute rule
- Can enter slightly above/below depending on market conditions

**Stop Loss**: Risk management level
- **ALWAYS SET YOUR STOP LOSS**
- Place slightly below suggested level for safety buffer
- Example: Suggested $44,800 ‚Üí Set $44,750

**Take Profit**: Target level
- Don't be greedy, take profits
- Consider partial profits at 50% of target
- Trail stop loss as price moves in your favor

### Position Sizing

**Conservative (Recommended)**:
```
Account Size: $10,000
Risk per Trade: 1-2% ($100-$200)
Stop Loss Distance: 2% ($900)

Position Size = Risk / Stop Loss Distance
Position Size = $200 / ($900 - Entry)
```

**Example**:
```
Entry: $45,000
Stop Loss: $44,100 (2% below)
Risk: $200 (2% of account)

Position Size = $200 / ($45,000 - $44,100)
Position Size = $200 / $900 = 0.222 BTC
```

### When to Exit

**Take Profit**:
- Price reaches take profit level ‚úÖ
- New STRONG SELL signal appears üî¥
- Fundamentals change (news, regulations)

**Cut Losses**:
- Stop loss triggered (no exceptions!) ‚ùå
- Strategy signals reverse
- Lower timeframe shows weakness

**Trailing Stop**:
- As price moves +2%, move stop to breakeven
- As price moves +4%, move stop to +2%

## Best Practices

### 1. Timeframe Confirmation

**Don't trade on one timeframe alone!**

‚úÖ **Good practice**:
```
4H: STRONG BUY (8 strategies)
1D: BUY (5 strategies)
‚Üí Confirmation across timeframes ‚úÖ
```

‚ùå **Bad practice**:
```
15m: STRONG BUY (6 strategies)
4H: NEUTRAL (1 strategy)
1D: SELL (4 strategies)
‚Üí Conflicting signals ‚ùå
```

### 2. Volume Confirmation

**High volume = More reliable**

‚úÖ Look for:
- Volume above 24h average
- Increasing volume on breakouts
- Volume Profile HVN support

### 3. Market Conditions

**Trending vs Ranging**:

**Trending Market** (use trend-following strategies):
- MA Crossover ‚úÖ
- EMA Ribbon ‚úÖ
- Ichimoku Cloud ‚úÖ

**Ranging Market** (use mean-reversion strategies):
- RSI Divergence ‚úÖ
- Bollinger Squeeze ‚úÖ
- Volume Profile ‚úÖ

### 4. AI Enhancement

- Base confidence is moderate (60-75%)

**When to ignore AI**:
- Only 1-2 strategies active
