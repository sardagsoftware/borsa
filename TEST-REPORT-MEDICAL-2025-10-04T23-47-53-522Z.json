        "response": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, which can lead to various symptoms and complications. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) and other clinical guidelines, the symptoms of atrial fibrillation can vary widely among individuals. Some people may have no symptoms at all and are only diagnosed during a physical examination or through an ECG (electrocardiogram) test for another reason. However, when symptoms are present, they may include:\n\n1. **Palpitations** - Described as sensations of a racing, uncomfortable, irregular heartbeat or a flip-flopping in your chest.\n2. **Weakness** - Reduced ability to perform physical activities that you normally handle easily.\n3. **Fatigue** - Feeling tired all the time, regardless of how much rest you get.\n4. **Lightheadedness** - Feeling dizzy or light-headed can occur and in some cases might lead to fainting (syncope).\n5. **Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea)** - Experiencing difficulty breathing during normal activities or even at rest.\n6. **Chest Pain** - In some cases, chest pain can occur, which is a critical symptom that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nIf you or someone else is experiencing these symptoms, particularly chest pain or severe breathing problems, it is crucial to seek immediate medical care. These symptoms can be indicative of serious conditions and require prompt evaluation. For ongoing management or if you suspect atrial fibrillation without severe acute symptoms, consulting with a cardiologist is recommended for appropriate diagnosis and management.\n\n---\nüìã **Clinician Review Required**\nThis output is for informational purposes only.
