2. **Drop Rates**: Increased common drops by +3% (68-77% from 65-75%)
3. **Vendor Pricing**: Reduced prices by ~10% based on usage data
4. **Boss Difficulty**: Target 55% success rate (was 48% in S1)

## Theme & Narrative

### Core Concept
**"Resonance storms sweep across the land, distorting reality through sound waves. Players must master acoustic puzzles and harness echo frequencies to uncover ancient harmonies."**

### Lore Hook
The Echo Sentinel, an ancient guardian, has awakened due to disrupted harmonic frequencies. Players must:
1. Investigate storm origins (Week 1-2)
2. Confront the Echo Sentinel (Week 2 & 5)
3. Discover the source of disruption (Week 3-4)
4. Restore harmonic balance (Week 6 finale)

### Tone & Aesthetic
- **Audio-Visual**: Pulsing sound waves visualized as colored frequencies
- **Weather**: Dynamic electrical storms, sand gales, wind patterns
- **Atmosphere**: Mystery + discovery + cooperative problem-solving
- **Inspiration**: Acoustic physics, ancient civilizations, storm mythology

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Boss Too Hard/Easy**: Mitigated by A/B HP testing (abx-boss-hp-storm)
2. **Economy Inflation**: Mitigated by stricter guardrails, canary deployment
3. **Co-op Low Adoption**: Mitigated by A/B frequency testing (abx-coop-optin)

### Medium Risks
1. **Photo Contest Low Participation**: Mitigated by prominent in-game promotion
2. **Storm Puzzle Completion < 70%**: Mitigated by A/B reward testing

### Low Risks
1. **i18n Translation Errors**: Mitigated by LQA process, native speaker review
2. **Canary Deployment Failures**: Mitigated by automated rollback system
