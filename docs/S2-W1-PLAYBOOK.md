# Season 2 Week 1 A/B Experimentation Playbook

**Date Range**: January 15-21, 2026 (Week 1)
**Status**: All experiments IN OBSERVATION (7-day minimum)
**Decision Timeline**: Week 2 conclusion (Jan 28, 2026)
**Analyst**: LiveOps Data Team

---

## Executive Summary

Week 1 of Season 2 has 3 active A/B experiments running concurrently:

1. **abx-coop-optin** - Co-op opt-in suggestion frequency
2. **abx-storm-reward** - Storm puzzle reward optimization
3. **abx-boss-hp-storm** - Boss HP tuning (Echo Sentinel)

**Current Status (Day 7 of 14):**
- ‚úÖ All experiments passed sample size checks
- ‚úÖ No SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch) detected
- ‚úÖ All guardrail metrics within safe bounds
- üü° Preliminary results available, but **7-day minimum observation** policy in effect
- üîµ **Decision deferred to Week 2 conclusion** (Jan 28) for statistical confidence

**Key Principle**: **Do not ship based on Week 1 data alone**. Small variance in early days can mislead. Require minimum 14-day observation for economy/difficulty experiments.

## 2. Week 1 Interim Analysis (Day 7)

### 2.1 Sample Size & SRM Checks

| Experiment        | Control N | Variant A N | Variant B N | Expected Ratio | Observed Ratio | SRM p-value | SRM Status |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| abx-coop-optin    | 9,124     | 9,087       | 9,139       | 33.3/33.3/33.3 | 33.2/33.1/33.3 | 0.94        | ‚úÖ PASS    |
| abx-storm-reward  | 6,832     | 6,791       | 6,845       | 33.3/33.3/33.3 | 33.3/33.1/33.4 | 0.88        | ‚úÖ PASS    |

| `session_duration`      | 42.3 min | 41.8 min  | 40.1 min  | -0.5 min         | -2.2 min         | 0.64        | 0.12        |
| `retention_d1`          | 43.2%    | 42.9%     | 42.1%     | -0.3pp           | -1.1pp           | 0.76        | 0.34        |

**Preliminary Observations**:
- üü¢ **Variant B shows +3.6pp lift** in co-op adoption (p=0.02, statistically significant at Day 7)
- üî¥ **Guardrail concern**: Prompt dismissal rate spiked to 61.2% in Variant B (above 70% threshold but approaching)
- üü° **Session duration trending down** in Variant B (-2.2 min, p=0.12, not yet significant)
- üü¢ **Retention D1 stable** (no harm detected)

**Week 2 Decision Criteria**:
- **Ship Variant B** IF: co-op adoption ‚â•+2.0pp AND prompt dismissal <70% AND retention stable
- **Ship Variant A** IF: co-op adoption ‚â•+1.5pp AND better guardrails than B
- **Keep Control** IF: guardrail violations or insufficient lift

#### ABX-STORM-REWARD (Day 7 Snapshot)

| Metric                  | Control | Variant A | Variant B | Œî vs Control (A) | Œî vs Control (B) | p-value (A) | p-value (B) |
|-------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|

**Preliminary Observations**:
- üü¢ **Variant B shows +6.1pp lift** in puzzle completion (p<0.001, highly significant)
- üî¥ **Guardrail violation**: Inflation index 1.11 in Variant B (exceeds 1.08 warning threshold)
- üü° **Earn/spend ratio 1.07** in Variant B (within 0.9-1.1 band, but trending high)
- üü¢ **Variant A shows moderate lift** (+2.9pp) with safer guardrails (inflation 1.08, borderline)

**Week 2 Decision Criteria**:
- **Ship Variant A** IF: completion lift ‚â•+2.5pp AND inflation <1.08 AND earn/spend <1.10
- **Do NOT ship Variant B** (inflation violation likely to persist)
- **Consider hotfix approach**: +5% rewards (between Control and Variant A) to split the difference

## 3. Statistical Methodology

### 3.1 Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)

MDE is the smallest effect size we can reliably detect with our sample size and desired statistical power.

**Formula** (for proportions):
```
MDE = (z_Œ±/2 + z_Œ≤) * sqrt( p*(1-p) * (1/n_control + 1/n_treatment) )
```

Where:
- `z_Œ±/2` = 1.96 (for Œ±=0.05, two-tailed)
- `z_Œ≤` = 0.84 (for Œ≤=0.20, power=80%)
- `p` = baseline proportion
- `n` = sample size per arm

**Example: abx-coop-optin**
- Baseline: p=0.25 (25% adoption)
- Sample size: n=8,400 per arm
- MDE = (1.96 + 0.84) * sqrt(0.25*0.75 * (2/8400)) = **0.020** (2.0pp)

**Interpretation**: We can detect a ‚â•2.0pp change in co-op adoption with 80% power.

---

### 3.2 Statistical Power

Power is the probability of detecting a true effect if it exists.

**Power Calculation** (post-hoc for Day 7 data):

| Experiment        | Observed Effect | MDE  | Achieved Power | Target Power |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|----------------|--------------|
| abx-coop-optin A  | +1.8pp          | 2.0pp| 62%            | 80%          |
| abx-coop-optin B  | +3.6pp          | 2.0pp| 94%            | 80%          |
| abx-storm-reward A| +2.9pp          | 3.0pp| 73%            | 80%          |
| abx-storm-reward B| +6.1pp          | 3.0pp| 99%            | 80%          |

**Interpretation**:
- Variant B arms (both experiments) have high achieved power (>90%) - effects are robust
- Variant A arms are underpowered at Day 7 (62-73%) - need Week 2 data to reach 80%

---

### 3.3 p-Value Thresholds & Multiple Comparisons

**Standard Threshold**: p < 0.05 (5% false positive rate)

**Bonferroni Correction** (for multiple comparisons):
- 2 variants per experiment ‚Üí adjusted Œ± = 0.05 / 2 = **0.025**
- **Decision Rule**: Require p < 0.025 to claim significance when comparing 2 variants to control

**Example**:
- abx-coop-optin Variant B: p=0.02 ‚Üí **Significant** (p < 0.025)
- abx-coop-optin Variant A: p=0.08 ‚Üí **Not significant** (p > 0.025)

**Sequential Testing Adjustment**:
- Since we're running 14-day experiments with Day 7 interim, apply **O'Brien-Fleming boundary**
- Day 7 interim: Require p < 0.005 to stop early (conservative)
- Day 14 final: Require p < 0.048 (spending function adjusted)

**Current Status**: No experiment meets p<0.005 for early stopping ‚Üí Continue to Day 14.

---

### 3.4 Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Test

SRM detects traffic allocation bugs (e.g., 40/30/30 split instead of 33/33/33).

**Chi-Square Test**:
```
œá¬≤ = Œ£ [(Observed - Expected)¬≤ / Expected]
```

**Example: abx-coop-optin**
- Expected: 9,117 / 9,117 / 9,117 (33.3% each, total 27,350)
- Observed: 9,124 / 9,087 / 9,139
- œá¬≤ = (9124-9117)¬≤/9117 + (9087-9117)¬≤/9117 + (9139-9117)¬≤/9117 = 0.12
- p-value = 0.94 (df=2) ‚Üí **No SRM detected** ‚úÖ

**Action**: If SRM p-value < 0.01, investigate traffic allocation bug before analyzing results.

---

## 4. Week 2 Decision Framework

### 4.1 Decision Tree

```
IF (Day 14 data available AND SRM pass AND guardrails safe):
    IF (primary metric lift ‚â• MDE AND p < 0.048):
        IF (ALL guardrails safe):
            ‚Üí SHIP variant
        ELSE:
            ‚Üí DO NOT SHIP (guardrail violation)
    ELSE:
        ‚Üí KEEP CONTROL (insufficient lift or not significant)
ELSE:
    ‚Üí EXTEND EXPERIMENT (collect more data)
```

### 4.2 Shipping Criteria

**abx-coop-optin**:
- ‚úÖ Ship IF: `coop_adoption_rate` lift ‚â•2.0pp AND p<0.048 AND `prompt_dismissal_rate`<70% AND `retention_d1` stable
- üü° Consider IF: lift ‚â•1.5pp AND p<0.05 AND all guardrails safe
- ‚ùå Kill IF: `prompt_dismissal_rate`‚â•70% OR `retention_d1` drop >2pp

**abx-storm-reward**:
- ‚úÖ Ship IF: `puzzle_completion_rate` lift ‚â•3.0pp AND p<0.048 AND `inflation_index`<1.08 AND `earn_spend_ratio`<1.10
- üü° Consider IF: lift ‚â•2.5pp AND p<0.05 AND inflation <1.10

## 5. Risk Mitigation

### 5.1 Experiment Interactions

**Risk**: abx-coop-optin and abx-storm-reward may interact (co-op players do more puzzles).

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor `coop_adoption_rate` in abx-storm-reward arms (check for imbalance)
- If co-op rate differs >3pp across storm-reward arms, flag as confound
- Post-hoc analysis: Stratify by co-op vs solo players

**Current Status (Day 7)**:
- Co-op rate in abx-storm-reward Control: 26.1%
- Co-op rate in abx-storm-reward Variant A: 26.3%
- Co-op rate in abx-storm-reward Variant B: 26.8%
- Œî = 0.7pp (within noise) ‚úÖ No interaction detected

---

### 5.2 Novelty Effect

**Risk**: Week 1 lifts may be due to novelty (players try new content), not sustained interest.

**Mitigation**:
- Require 14-day minimum observation (covers novelty decay)
- Monitor Day 1-7 vs Day 8-14 trends
- If Day 8-14 shows regression, flag as novelty effect

**Example**:
- IF `puzzle_completion_rate` Day 1-7: 71.3% BUT Day 8-14: 67.2% ‚Üí Novelty effect, adjust expectations

---

### 5.3 Weekend vs Weekday Variance

**Risk**: Week 1 includes only 1 weekend (Jan 18-19). Week 2 adds another (Jan 25-26).

**Mitigation**:
- Segment analysis by weekday vs weekend
- Ensure both weeks capture weekend behavior
- Use mixed-effects model if weekend variance is high

**Current Status (Day 7)**:
- Weekend co-op adoption: 28.4% (vs 25.6% weekday) ‚Üí +2.8pp weekend lift
- Include weekend effects in final model

---

### 5.4 External Events

**Risk**: External events (e.g., streamer promotion, competitor launch) bias results.

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor social mentions, DAU spikes
- Log external events in experiment notes
- If major event detected, extend experiment or discount data

**Current Status (Day 7)**:
- No major external events detected ‚úÖ
- DAU stable at 2,600-2,750 range

---

---

## 7. Post-Experiment Checklist (Week 2)

When Day 14 data is available:

- [ ] Run final SRM check (œá¬≤ test, p>0.01 required)
- [ ] Run final statistical tests (two-proportion z-test, Bonferroni adjusted)
- [ ] Check all guardrail metrics (flagged if any violations)
- [ ] Segment analysis (weekend vs weekday, co-op vs solo)
- [ ] Novelty effect check (Day 1-7 vs Day 8-14 trends)
- [ ] Document decision rationale (ship, kill, or extend)
- [ ] Generate rollout plan (if shipping) or kill plan (if discontinuing)
- [ ] Update experiment registry with final status
- [ ] Post-mortem report (what worked, what didn't, learnings)

---

## 8. Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Week 1 Learnings

1. **7-day data is insufficient for economy experiments**: Variance too high, need 14 days minimum
2. **Guardrail violations are decisive**: Even if primary metric wins, inflation violation = kill
3. **Weekend behavior differs significantly**: Always include 2 weekends in experiment duration
4. **Prompt frequency has limits**: abx-coop-optin Variant B approaching annoyance threshold
5. **SRM checks are critical**: Must verify traffic split before analyzing results

### Best Practices Confirmed

- ‚úÖ **Pre-register experiments**: Documented in `/LiveOps/experiments/s2-ab/*.json`
- ‚úÖ **Define MDE upfront**: Ensures adequate power
- ‚úÖ **Set guardrails explicitly**: Prevents shipping harmful variants
- ‚úÖ **Interim analysis at Day 7**: Catch critical issues early, but don't ship early
- ‚úÖ **Bonferroni correction**: Protects against false positives in multi-arm tests

---

## 9. Week 2 Action Items

### For Data Team

- [ ] Continue daily monitoring of all 3 experiments
- [ ] Generate Day 14 final reports (Jan 28)
- [ ] Prepare decision deck for Jan 29 meeting
- [ ] Post-hoc analysis: Stratify by co-op vs solo, weekend vs weekday

### For Economy Team

- [ ] Review abx-storm-reward guardrail violation
- [ ] Prepare alternative: +5% reward hotfix (between Control and Variant A)
- [ ] If abx-boss-hp-storm shows HP too high, prepare hotfix

### For LiveOps Team

- [ ] Monitor abx-boss-hp-storm launch (Jan 22)
- [ ] Coordinate decision meeting (Jan 29)
- [ ] Prepare rollout plans for winning variants

---

## 10. Compliance & Audit

### KVKK/GDPR/PDPL Compliance
