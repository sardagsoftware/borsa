## API SETUP STATUS

### HF_API_TOKEN
**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT SET**
**Required:** Yes (for programmatic upload)
**Scope:** Write access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Create token with "write" scope
3. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export HF_API_TOKEN="hf_xxxx...xxxx"
   ```

### Manual Upload Alternative
Since API token is not configured and "0 mock" policy applies:
1. **Web Interface Upload** (Recommended for initial setup)
2. **Git-based Upload** (After repository creation)
3. **Python Library** (After token configured)

All methods documented in `HF_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk: API Token Not Configured
**Impact:** Cannot automate repository creation/upload
**Severity:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
1. Documented manual setup (3 methods)
2. Web interface upload (no token needed)
3. Post-setup automation script provided

### Risk: Repository Name Conflict
**Impact:** `lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed` may already exist
**Severity:** Low
**Mitigation:**
1. Check availability first
2. Alternative names: `lydian-ai/discovery-feed`, `lydian-ai/model-feed`
3. Documented in troubleshooting

### Risk: License Misunderstanding
**Impact:** Users may think CC BY 4.0 applies to models themselves
**Severity:** Low
**Mitigation:**
1. Clear notice in LICENSE file
2. Repeated in README and card.md
3. Individual model licenses in `license` field

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Manual)
1. **Create HF account** (if not exists): https://huggingface.co/join
2. **Generate API token** (write scope): https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
3. **Set environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export HF_API_TOKEN="hf_xxxx...xxxx"
   ```

### Short-term (PHASE C Prerequisite)
1. **Create repository** (web interface or API)
2. **Upload files** (README.md, card.md, LICENSE)
3. **Verify visibility:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed

### Long-term (Post-PHASE C)
1. **Update README** with live feed URLs
2. **Add feed files** to repository (optional)
3. **Set up daily updates** (automated)

---

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### After Manual Setup
```bash
# Verify repository exists
curl -I https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed
# Expected: HTTP/2 200

# Verify README accessible
curl https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed/raw/main/README.md
# Expected: Full README content

# Verify card.md accessible
curl https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed/raw/main/card.md
# Expected: Full card.md content

# Verify LICENSE accessible
curl https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed/raw/main/LICENSE
# Expected: CC BY 4.0 license text
```

## SUMMARY

**PHASE B: ✅ FILES READY | ⏳ MANUAL UPLOAD REQUIRED**

All Hugging Face repository files have been created locally:
- ✅ README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- ✅ card.md (dataset card with metadata)
- ✅ LICENSE (CC BY 4.0)
- ✅ HF_SETUP_GUIDE.md (manual setup instructions)

**Files are white-hat compliant, TOS-compliant, and ready for upload.**

Since `HF_API_TOKEN` is not configured (per "0 mock" policy), manual upload is required using one of three methods documented in `HF_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

**Compliance:** 100% White-Hat · 0 Mock · Secrets Masked · TOS Compliant

**Ready for PHASE C: FEED & GEO FILES (on-site generation)**

**Generated:** 2025-10-09T16:00:00Z
**Next Phase:** C - FEED & GEO FILES
**Repository:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/lydian-ai/lydian-discovery-feed (after manual setup)
