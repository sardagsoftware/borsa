## Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Bug (P0)
**Trigger**: Game-breaking bug (e.g., players can't log in, infinite CR exploit)
**Action**:
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected feature via feature flag
2. **If not fixable in <1h**: Execute rollback
   ```bash
   ./LiveOps/runbook/rollback.sh --season s2 --target full --confirm
   ```
3. **Communicate**: In-game message "Maintenance in progress"
4. **Fix**: Deploy hotfix to staging, test, then prod
5. **Post-mortem**: Within 24h

### Scenario 2: Performance Degradation
**Trigger**: P95 latency >200ms sustained for >10min
**Action**:
1. **Investigate**: Check server CPU/memory, database queries
2. **If S2-related**: Rollback specific S2 feature (e.g., storm puzzle module)
3. **If infrastructure**: Scale up (add servers, increase cache)
4. **Monitor**: If not improved in 15min, full rollback

### Scenario 3: Economy Breach
**Trigger**: Inflation >1.15 OR earn/spend ratio >1.20
**Action**:
1. **Auto-rollback**: Triggered automatically (no human intervention needed)
2. **Restore**: Economy balance reverted to pre-S2 state
3. **Analyze**: Review transaction logs for anomalies
4. **Fix**: Adjust drop rates/vendor prices, re-deploy via canary
